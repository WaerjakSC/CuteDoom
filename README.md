## API Information (As of 27.12.19)

### Interactable Interface
This interface is used as a kind of 'tag' to check for actors that implement it. 
We can also create functions in the IInteractable class that have to be overridden by every class that uses the interface. Each class will have a different implementation that decides how it will react to the player.
